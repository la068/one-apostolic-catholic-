            <p>Confession: Christ’s Gift of Mercy Through His Church</p>
<p>What the Catholic Church Teaches</p>
<p>Confession, also called the Sacrament of Penance or Reconciliation, is the sacrament by which sins committed after Baptism are forgiven. It was instituted by Jesus Christ Himself when He gave the Apostles authority to forgive sins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.” (John 20:22–23)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Catechism of the Catholic Church says:
“Those who approach the sacrament of Penance obtain pardon from God’s mercy for the offense committed against Him, and are at the same time reconciled with the Church.” (CCC 1422)</p>
<p>Through Confession, we are not only forgiven by God but also healed spiritually and restored to communion with the Body of Christ.</p>
<hr>
<p>Why Catholics Confess to a Priest</p>
<p>Some Christians argue, “Why confess to a priest when I can go directly to God?”</p>
<p>Catholics do confess directly to God — but Jesus gave His priests the authority to act as His representatives.</p>
<p>Just as God uses human ministers to baptize, marry, and preach, He also uses them to forgive sins sacramentally.</p>
<p>The priest is not forgiving by his own power — he forgives in the name of Christ.</p>
<hr>
<p>Common Protestant Objections and Catholic Responses</p>
<ol>
<li>“Only God can forgive sins.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Catholic Response: Absolutely — only God can forgive sins. But He chooses to forgive through His priests. In John 20:22–23, Jesus gives the Apostles the authority to forgive or retain sins. If God did not intend priests to forgive, why would Christ give such power?</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>“Confession is not in the Bible.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Catholic Response: It is.</p>
<p>James 5:16 — “Confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed.”</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5:18 — “God… gave us the ministry of reconciliation.”</p>
<p>John 20:23 — explicit authority to forgive sins.</p>
<p>From the earliest centuries, Christians confessed their sins to bishops and priests — this is documented in the writings of the Church Fathers.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>“I confess in private prayer; that’s enough.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Catholic Response: Personal prayer is good, but Christ gave us a sacrament for certainty and grace. When the priest says, “I absolve you,” you have the assurance that your sins are truly forgiven. Without the sacrament, you rely on feelings — but with Confession, you receive a clear sacramental guarantee.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Healing Power of Confession</p>
<p>Confession not only forgives sin but also strengthens the soul. Many Catholics testify to the peace that comes after honestly confessing and hearing the words of absolution. The sacrament brings:</p>
<p>Forgiveness of mortal and venial sins</p>
<p>Healing of spiritual wounds caused by sin</p>
<p>Strength against future temptation</p>
<p>Restoration of grace and deeper union with God</p>
<hr>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Confession is not a human invention, but a divine gift. Jesus entrusted His Apostles and their successors with the power to forgive sins so that His mercy could reach us tangibly.</p>
<p>Far from being a burden, Confession is a channel of freedom. The sinner kneels before the priest, but truly confesses before Christ Himself, who acts through His Church.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through Confession, the Catholic encounters not judgment but mercy, not despair but hope, not death but life.</p>
