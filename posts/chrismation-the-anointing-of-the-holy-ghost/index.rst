Chrismation: The Anointing with the Holy Spirit
.. TEASER_END
What Chrismation Is

Chrismation is the sacrament in which a baptized person receives the gift of the Holy Spirit. It is sometimes called the “anointing” and is closely associated with Confirmation in the Western Church. In Apostolic Catholic practice, Chrismation is often administered immediately after Baptism, even for infants, as part of the initiation into the Church.

The priest or bishop anoints the baptized person with holy chrism oil, saying:

> “The seal of the gift of the Holy Spirit.”



Through this sacrament, the person is strengthened by the Holy Spirit to live as a Christian, bear witness to Christ, and grow in holiness.

Biblical Basis

Acts 8:14–17 — The Apostles laid hands on baptized believers to receive the Holy Spirit.

Acts 19:6 — “When Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them.”

These passages show that the Holy Spirit was conferred sacramentally through the Church’s ministry.

Connection with Baptism

In the Apostolic tradition:

Baptism washes away original sin and begins the Christian life.

Chrismation completes the initiation by imparting the Holy Spirit to strengthen the soul.

Together, these sacraments unite the believer with Christ, the Church, and the gifts of the Spirit.


The Catechism of the Catholic Church notes:
“By the sacrament of Confirmation [Chrismation], the baptized are more perfectly bound to the Church and are enriched with a special strength of the Holy Spirit.” (CCC 1285)

Common Misunderstandings

Some Protestant groups claim:

“The Holy Spirit comes automatically at Baptism; Chrismation/Confirmation isn’t necessary.”

Catholic Response: While Baptism brings the Holy Spirit, Chrismation confers the fullness of the Spirit’s gifts. It is a visible, sacramental strengthening for Christian life. Scripture shows the Apostles laying hands and praying for the Spirit to come (Acts 8:17), which supports the sacramental action.

“It’s just symbolic, not a real grace.”

Catholic Response: Like all sacraments, Chrismation is a means of grace instituted by Christ. The Holy Spirit truly comes upon the person, empowering them to live a holy life.

The Gifts of the Holy Spirit

Through Chrismation, the believer receives the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit:

1. Wisdom


2. Understanding


3. Counsel


4. Fortitude


5. Knowledge


6. Piety


7. Fear of the Lord



These gifts guide Christians to grow in virtue, love, and witness to Christ.

Conclusion

Chrismation is a profound sacrament of grace, marking the believer with the seal of the Holy Spirit. It strengthens the baptized for a life of faith, courage, and service to God and His Church.

> “But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be my witnesses…” (Acts 1:8)



In the Apostolic Catholic tradition, Baptism, Chrismation, and the Eucharist together fully initiate a person into the life of Christ and His Church.
