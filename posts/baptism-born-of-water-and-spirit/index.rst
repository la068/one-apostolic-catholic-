1. Baptism: Born of Water and Spirit

Baptism is the sacrament that washes away original sin and makes us children of God. Through it, we are initiated into the Church and begin the journey of Christian life.

Jesus commanded His disciples:

> “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.” (Matthew 28:19)



In Baptism, we are spiritually reborn, receiving grace to live a holy life. Infants and adults alike are welcomed into God’s family, showing that salvation is a gift from Him, not earned by human understanding.

Some misunderstandings exist:

1. “It’s just symbolic.” — Baptism truly cleanses the soul from sin.


2. “Infants shouldn’t be baptized.” — God’s grace is for all; Christ welcomed children.


3. “Faith alone is enough.” — Faith is essential, but Baptism is the ordinary means of entering God’s kingdom.



Baptism is the beginning of a lifelong relationship with Christ. It unites us to His Church, marks us permanently as God’s children, and opens the door to all other sacraments.

> “Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.” (John 3:5)



Receiving Baptism is more than a ritual — it is a divine rebirth and the first step into the grace-filled life God calls us to.
